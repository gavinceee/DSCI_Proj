# DSCI 100 – Individual Project Planning Stage

This repository contains the materials Gavin Gao's Individual Planning Report for the DSCI 100 course project.

## Contents
* `proj_ind.ipynb` — The full Jupyter Notebook containing code, plots, exploratory analysis, and the proposed modelling plan.
* `proj_ind.html` — The rendered HTML version of the notebook for grading.

## Project Summary
The project explores the **players.csv** dataset from the PLAICraft research server.  
My specific research question is:

**Can a player's experience level, age, gender, and total hours played predict whether they subscribe to the game-related newsletter?**

The notebook includes:
* A full dataset description  
* A clearly stated broad and specific question  
* Exploratory data analysis and visualizations  
* A proposed classification method (K-NN) with justification  
* A high-level plan for data processing, tuning, and evaluation

## Reproducibility
The notebook is self-contained and runs from top to bottom.  
players.csv and sessions.csv are assumed to be in the same directory as the notbook.
